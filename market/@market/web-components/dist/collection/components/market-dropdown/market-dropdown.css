    This emoji selector is a weird hack that doesn't actually do anything
    visually, but it fixes a strange bug in which Safari does not repaint styles
    on slotted content when the parent selector changes. This element selector,
    if it existed in the template (which it doesn't) would be part of the
    dropdown's shadowDOM, as opposed to the slotted content, which is part of
    the lightDOM. For some reason adding this selector here causes Safari to
    repaint the slotted content as well. -jbiggs

    not immediately open on click: https://github.com/squareup/market/issues/2588
